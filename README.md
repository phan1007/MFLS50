# Abstract
Multibeam forward-looking sonar object tracking is a fundamental task in underwater robotics, with numerous essential applications, such as autonomous underwater docking, inspection of subsea pipelines, and biological investigation, etc. However, progress in this area has been limited compared to other video tracking problems due to the lack of specialized benchmarks. In this paper, we introduce MFS2oT, the first multibeam forward-looking sonar single object tracking benchmark dataset. MFS2oT contains 50 videos and 15,842 frames, and covers 11 scenario attributes. A key feature of MFS2oT is its inclusion of challenging real-world underwater scenarios, such as fake target, tugboat wake, and random rays interfere. We benchmark the performance of 25 state-of-the-art tracking algorithms. Additionally, we introduce a self-correction tracking baseline to improve the performance that leverages temporal context information and a correlation filter based tracker with hybrid regularizers. Extensive qualitative and quantitative results show that our approach achieves superior tracking performance on the proposed benchmark. The proposed MFS2oT will significantly advance research in intelligent sonar object tracking and related applications. The dataset and the evaluation as well as our analysis are available at https://github.com/phan1007/MFLS50.

# Proposed Method
In this paper, an efficient temporal contextual tracker with truncated $\ell_{1}$-$\ell_{2}$ sparsity and aberrances repression regularization (TCL1-L2ARDCF) is developed within the framework. The main idea of the proposed tracker is to utilize the temporal context information of multiple trackers when model drifting by inappropriate model updates. The proposed method is composed of six steps:1) parameters initialization; 2) determine $n$ trackers using different model updating strategies; 3) forward tracking; 4) backward tracking; 5) robustness evaluation; 6) initialization of a group of trackers with the results of the best tracking trajectory, then next track. 
## An example for the update strategies of 4 trackers in the interval is:
